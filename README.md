First you will have to correctly assemble a Material Point Scanner.
Then you will need two yolol chips two displays (Preferably Text Panels) and three buttons

Copy and paste the yolol scripts from here into those chips line by line.
Then rename the Material Point Scanners fields like so (From top to bottom)

Scanner
CurrentMaterial
NumberOfMaterials
MaterialName
MaterialAmount
Scan
Reset

Now you can rename the one of the displays as Material and the Other as Amount, you can also make one with the name NumberOfMaterials if you so desire.
Then name the three buttons as
StartScan Back Next

Now if you point at an asteroid and press the StartScan button you should be able to see the material and amount on the screens.
